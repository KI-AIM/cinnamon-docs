# Configuring Cinnamon

Cinnamon has a modular design and is highly configurable.
The Spring Boot based modules, i.e. Cinnamon Anonymization and Cinnamon Platform, can be configured via their respective `application.properties` files inside `src/main/resources`.
External configuration files are currently not loaded, therefore changes must be made directly within the project before building.
Alternatively environment variables can be used like the `docker-compose.yml` does.
All other modules currently do not support configurability.

## Configuring Cinnamon Anonymization

**CORS**

Setting origins for CORS can be done like this:
```properties
cinnamon.corsAllowedOrigins=http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:8080
```

**API Documentation**

Cinnamon Anonymization provides endpoints for fetching API documentation in the Open API format and as a Swagger HTML page.
The path of both endpoints can be configured with the following properties:
```properties
springdoc.api-docs.path=/api-docs/anonymization
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/api/doc/anonymization
```

**Port**

The port configuration is only applied when starting Cinnamon Anonymization with Spring's internal Tomcat server.
The provided Docker images use an external Tomcat server, so this setting has no effect in this case.

```properties
server.port=8081
```

## Configuring Cinnamon Platform

Configurations that are not documented here shouldn't be changed when setting up a server.

**CORS**

Configuring CORS can be done like this:
```properties
cinnamon.corsAllowedOrigins=http://localhost:4200,http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**API Documentation**

Cinnamon Platform provides endpoints for fetching API documentation in the Open API format and as a Swagger HTML page.
The path of both endpoints can be configured by properties.
When modifying the URLs in the configuration, the `filterChain` inside `SecurityConfig` has to be adapted to accordingly in order to allow unauthenticated users to access the documentation.

```properties
springdoc.api-docs.path=/api-docs
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/api/doc
```

**Port**

The port configuration is only applied when starting Cinnamon Platform with Springs internal Tomcat server.
The provided Docker images use an external Tomcat server, so this setting has no effect when using these images.

```properties
server.port=8080
```

**Demo Instance**

Cinnamon Platform has build in support for running the application as a demo instance.
This enables daily database cleanups and displays a disclaimer in the frontend.

```properties
cinnamon.is-demo-instance=false
```

**Database**

Cinnamon Platform only supports PostgreSQL as the underlying database.
However names of the database and the user, as well as the password can be chosen freely.
The password must be set before deploying Cinnamon Platform.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cinnamon_db
spring.datasource.username=cinnamon_user
spring.datasource.password=
```

**Project Workflow**

The workflow for all projects is defined by the structure of the internal pipeline that is configured via properties.
The pipeline follows a classic approach and is split into stages, which in turn are split into jobs.
Each job is tied to an endpoint of an external server which manages process instances on that server.
Additionally, configurations can be defined and send alongside the data when starting processes.

**External Server**

First, the server that provides endpoints for running processes has to be defined.
This is done by defining properties in the following form: `cinnamon.external-server.<numeric key>.<property>`.
The following properties must be defined:

| Property              | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| callback-host         | The host name of Cinnamon Platform under which the external server can reach it. Used for callbacks when a process has been finished.                                                   |
| url-client            | URL under which the user's browser can reach the external server.                                                                                                                      |
| url-server            | URL under which the platform can reach the external server.                                                                                                                            |
| max-parallel-processes| The number of processes the server can run at the same time. If starting a process would exceed the maximum number, the process will be scheduled and started when capacities are available. This property is also available on the endpoint level. |

Below is an example of the default configuration for the anonymization server.

```properties
cinnamon.external-server.0.callback-host=localhost
cinnamon.external-server.0.max-parallel-process=1
cinnamon.external-server.0.url-client=http://localhost:8081
cinnamon.external-server.0.url-server=http://localhost:8081
```

**External Configuration**

The structure of configuration pages are fetched dynamically from the external server.
Endpoints that provide these definitions can be defined using the form `cinnamon.external-configuration.<configuration name>.<property>` and providing the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| algorithm-endpoint | Endpoint for fetching available algorithms. |
| external-server-index | Index of corresponding external server. |

Again an example for the anonymization:

```properties
cinnamon.external-configuration.anonymization.algorithm-endpoint=/api/anonymization/algorithms
cinnamon.external-configuration.anonymization.external-server-index=0
```

**External Endpoint**

Before defining the jobs in the pipeline, their corresponding endpoints have to be defined.
This is done by creating entries in the form of `cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.<numerical key>.<property>` with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| callback-part-name | Name of the request part for the callback URL, defaults to `callback`. |
| cancel-endpoint    | Endpoint for cancelling a process. |
| cancel-http-method | HTTP method used for cancel request, defaults to `post`. |
| configuration-encoding | Encoding of the configuration. Options are:<br/><br/>`json`: JSON inside body.<br/>`file`: YAML inside a file. |
| configuration-name | Name of the configuration to be used. |
| configuration-part-name | Name of the request for the configuration. |
| external-server-index | Index of corresponding external server. |
| inputs             | List of input datasets. See below. |
| max-parallel-process | Number of parallel processes one endpoint can run.  |
| outputs            | List of outputs. See below. |
| process-endpoint   | Endpoint for starting the process. If empty the path from the algorithm definition is used. |
| status-endpoint    | Endpoint for fetching the status of a process. If starting a process would exceed the max number, the process will be scheduled and started when capacities are available. This property is also available on the external server level. |

All properties defining an endpoint (i.e. `cancel-endpoint`, `process_endpoint` and `status-endpoint`) support placeholders.
Currently, the following values are injected into the URL:

| Placeholder | Replaced Value |
| - | - |
| PROCESS_ID | ID of the process |

Input datasets can be defined using `cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.<numerical key>.inputs[<index>].<property>`.

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| data-configuration-name | Name of the request parameter for the dataset configuration if encoding is `file`. |
| encoding | Encoding of the dataset. Options are:<br/><br/>`file`: Data as CSV file and separate data configuration (see data-configuration-name).<br/>`json`: Dateset and data configuration as JSON body. |
| file-name | Name of the file if encoding is `file`. |
| part-name | Name of the request part for the data. |
| selector | Selects the dataset. Options are:<br/><br/>`HOLD_OUT`: Hold out split of original dataset.<br/>`LAST_OR_ORIGINAL`: Last result or the original dataset.<br/>`ORIGINAL`: Original dataset.<br/>`OWNER`: The associated dataset (used for statistics). |

Outputs are any files created by the processes and can be defined in the following form: `cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.<numerical key>.outputs[<index>].<property>`.
The following properties have to be defined:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| encoding | Content of the output. Options are:<br/><br/>`DATA`:  Data as a CSV file.<br/>`DATA_SET`: Dataset and data configuration as JSON inside the body.<br/>`ERROR`: Error message as plain text.<br/>`FILE`: Generic file with arbitrary content (used for example for statistics or additional data from the synthetization module). |
| part-name | Name of the request part. |

This is a complete example for the anonymization process:

```properties
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.callback-part-name=callback
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.cancel-endpoint=/api/anonymization/process/PROCESS_ID/cancel
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.cancel-http-method=post
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.configuration-encoding=json
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.configuration-name=anonymization
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.configuration-part-name=anonymizationConfig
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.external-server-index=0
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.inputs[0].encoding=json
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.inputs[0].part-name=data
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.inputs[0].selector=last_or_original
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.max-parallel-process=1
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.outputs[0].encoding=data_set
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.outputs[0].part-name=anonymized_dataset
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.outputs[1].encoding=error
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.outputs[1].part-name=exception_message
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.pre-processors=
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.process-endpoint=
cinnamon.external-server-endpoints.0.status-endpoint=/api/anonymization/process/PROCESS_ID/status
```

**Statistics Endpoint**

The endpoint that is used for calculating statistics is a bit special, as it is used for all datasets and requires a specific configuration.
First, the `process_endpoint` has to be defined.
Furthermore, the endpoint takes one input dataset where the `selector` has to be set to `owner`.
In order to mark an endpoint to be used for calculating the statistics, the following property is used:

```properties
cinnamon.statistics-endpoint=3
```

**Pipelines**

Last, the pipelines can be defined in the configuration.
Steps are defined by creating properties in the form of `cinnamon.steps.<step name>.<property>`.

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| external-server-endpoint-index | Numeric key of the endpoint to be used |
| fix-status | Specific for the Cinnamon Synthetization module. Updates the process status after it is finished. |
| type | The type of the process. Options are:<br/><br/>`data_processing`: Marks process to create a new dataset.<br/>`evaluation`: Marks process to return evaluation results. |

The following examples shows the step for the anonymization job:

```properties
cinnamon.steps.anonymization.external-server-endpoint-index=0
cinnamon.steps.anonymization.fix-status=false
cinnamon.steps.anonymization.step-type=data_processing
```

A stage is a list of jobs in the form `cinnamon.stages.<stage name>.jobs[<number>]=<job name>`:

```properties
cinnamon.stages.execution.jobs[0]=anonymization
cinnamon.stages.execution.jobs[1]=synthetization
```

And finally the pipeline is a list of stages in the form `cinnamon.pipeline.stages[<number>]=<stage name>`:

```properties
cinnamon.pipeline.stages[0]=execution
cinnamon.pipeline.stages[1]=evaluation
```

## Configuring Docker Compose

When deploying Cinnamon with Docker Compose, all properties can be configured by using environment variables inside the docker-compose.yml.
Furthermore, the most important properties have been moved into a `.env` file.
This file has to be placed inside the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`, so docker recognises the file.
The following variables can be configured using the `.env` file:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| IS_DEMO_INSTANCE | Flag to enable demo instance, defaults to `false`. |
| PG_DATABASE | Name of the database. |
| PG_PASSWORD | Password of the database user. |
| PG_USERNAME | Name of the database user. |

The final file could look like this:

```properties
IS_DEMO_INSTANCE="false"
PG_DATABASE="cinnamon_db"
PG_PASSWORD="changeme"
PG_USERNAME="cinnamon_user"
```
