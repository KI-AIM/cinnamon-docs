# Welcome to the Cinnamon Documentation

Welcome to the Cinnamon documentation! This is your go-to resource for understanding and navigating our platform, which provides solutions for dynamic data anonymization and synthetization.

## About the Project

Cinnamon is a modular application designed to offer robust functionalities for data anonymization, synthetization, and evaluation. Our platform supports a wide array of algorithms and currently processes tabular data, with future plans to integrate HL7 FHIR. Each component operates independently, allowing for seamless integration and customization according to your needs.


## Work in Progress
Please note that both the application and this documentation are works in progress. Our team is continuously developing new features and enhancements, and we are dedicated to expanding this wiki to provide comprehensive resources. We appreciate your patience as we build and improve upon this platform.

##Get Involved
We welcome contributions and feedback from users and developers alike. If youâ€™re interested in participating in the project or have questions, please feel free to reach out. Your insights and expertise could be a valuable addition to our ongoing efforts to make Cinnamon the best it can be.
