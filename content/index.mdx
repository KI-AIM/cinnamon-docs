# Welcome to the Cinnamon Documentation

Welcome to the Cinnamon documentation! This is your go-to resource for understanding and navigating our platform, which provides solutions for dynamic data anonymization and synthetization.

## About the Project

Cinnamon is a modular application designed to offer robust functionalities for data anonymization, synthetization, and evaluation. Our platform supports a wide array of algorithms and currently processes tabular data, with future plans to integrate HL7 FHIR. Each component operates independently, allowing for seamless integration and customization according to your needs.

## Key Features
- **Modular Framework**: Cinnamon's design makes it simple to add new features and functionalities. This modular approach ensures the platform can be customized to fit specific requirements.
- **Data Anonymization and Synthetization**: By incorporating methods for anonymizing and synthetizing data, Cinnamon helps protect sensitive information while still allowing for data use.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Module**: The evaluation module provides clear, concise results, converting complex data protection processes into understandable insights.
- **Support for Various Data Formats**: Cinnamon handles multiple data formats, including CSV and Excel, and we're working to include support for medical formats like FHIR, enabling versatility across industries.
- **Guided Workflow**: Cinnamon offers guidance through complex data protection functions, making it accessible to users regardless of their experience level.
