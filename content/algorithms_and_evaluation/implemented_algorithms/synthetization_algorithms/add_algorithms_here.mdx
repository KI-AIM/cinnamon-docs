# Synthetic Data Generation Algorithms

## CTGAN

CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN) is a GAN-based method specifically designed for generating synthetic tabular data. It addresses the challenges of modeling tabular data with mixed categorical and continuous columns and imbalanced categorical columns.

**Key features:**
- Uses mode-specific normalization for continuous columns
- Employs conditional generation to handle imbalanced categorical data
- Applies training-by-sampling to manage multi-dimensional categorical columns

## TVAE

TVAE (Tabular Variational Autoencoder) is a deep learning method that uses variational autoencoders adapted for tabular data generation. It learns the underlying data distribution and generates synthetic samples that preserve statistical properties of the original data.

**Key features:**
- Employs a variational autoencoder architecture tailored for tabular data
- Handles mixed data types (numerical and categorical)
- Typically provides good performance on datasets with complex correlations
- Often faster to train than GAN-based approaches
