# Modular Design

Cinnamon's functionalities are divided into distinct modules:
- [Cinnamon Platform](/platform_architecture/modules/platform)
- [Cinnamon Anonymization](/platform_architecture/modules/anonymization)
- [Cinnamon Synthetization](/platform_architecture/modules/synthetization)
- [Cinnamon Evaluation](/platform_architecture/modules/evaluation)
- [Cinnamon Risk-Assessment](/platform_architecture/modules/risk_assessment)

Cinnamon Platform acts as the center of the platform and is responsible for integrating all the other modules into Cinnamon.
The platform manages the data flow and controls processes running on other modules.
Communication is only done between platform and other modules, allowing each module to function independently.
This modular design ensures that modules can be swapped with custom implementations, as long as the required API endpoints are implemented.
